# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

    The overview of the project is to use charts and graphs to analyze data for Theaters and Plays to help our business partner understand how the kickstarter campaigns fared. 


### Purpose

    The purpose of this is to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

    When looking at the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date, one could draw several conclusions. The first being that May and June are the two most successful months by a large margin. On the contrary, the number of successful and failed campagins are the most similar and lowest overall, during the last quarter of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

    Analyzing Plays by goals, we can see that those plays that had a low monetary goal, had the best success rate. Another conclusion that can be drawn is that as cost of the plays increase, there are fewer amount of plays. Additionally, the success rate drops substantially as cost goes up. There are some outliers, but the data is not statistically significant because of the low number of plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

    During this analysis, there were some difficulties encountered. The first difficulty was that of a technical nature, I did not fully grasp the countIfs statement. Overcomming that was done by using my resources to learn more about how to write the logic statement. 

## Results

    There are limitations to the data set due to the inconsitency of sample size for different goals. 

    We could create more graphs and charts that compare different campagins based on type, rather than sticking with Theater and Plays.
